# advent-of-code-2024

This is my attempt at [Advent Of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/), let's see how far we get!

### Tech stack

- NodeJS
- Typescript
- Mocha + Chai
- Yarn

### Structure

Solutions are structured as follows. Test files (or spec files) live in the same folder as the implementation.
They can be run using `yarn test`.

```
src/
  day1/
    solution.ts
    solution.test.ts
  day2/
    ...
  ...
```
